# DIFFIRENC BETWEEN BLOCK STORAGE AND OBJECT STORSGE?
ANS-: 1 BLOCK STORAGE- 1) Block storage provides raw storage volumes that can be attached to compute instances such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances
2) It operates at the block level, meaning it manages data in fixed-sized blocks and doesn't have any knowledge of the file structure.
3) Block storage is commonly used for databases, file systems, and applications that require low-level access to storage.
4)  Provides low-level access to raw storage and is often used as a block device attached to a specific compute instance.
2 OBJECT STORAGE-: 1)Objects are stored with metadata and a unique identifier, and they are organized in a flat address space. 
2)Object storage is ideal for scenarios where you need scalable and durable storage for large amounts of data, such as backup and restore, media storage, and content distribution.
3)Stores data as objects with associated metadata and is suitable for unstructured data
4)Provides seamless scalability, often with automatic load balancing and distribution across multiple servers.
# DIFFERNCE BETWEEN STATIC WEBSITE AND DYNAMIC WEBSITE?
ANS-: STAIIC WEBSITE - 1) A static website consists of fixed, unchanging files that are directly served to the useR
2)The content remains the same for all users and is created during the development phase.
3) Static websites are often built using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.
4) Static websites tend to load faster because the content is already created and doesn't require server-side processing before being sent to the user's browser.
DYNAMIC WEBSITE-1)Dynamic websites generate content on the server side in real-time based on user requests and interactions.
2) Dynamic websites use server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) and may involve a database to retrieve and deliver content
3) Dynamic websites can be slower to load because content is generated on the server in response to user requests.
4)E-commerce sites, social media platforms, content management systems (CMS), web applications with interactive features.
# WHAT ARE THE NAMING RULE ?
ANS-:1 NOT USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS 2 NOT USE DOMAIN NAME 3 NOT USE IP ADDRESS 4 NOT USE CAPITAL LATERS 
# WHAT IS THE MAJOR RESOURCE OF S3 BUKET ?
ANS-:  An S3 bucket is a container for storing objects, and it serves as the fundamental resource in the S3 storage system. Buckets are used to organize and control access to your data stored in S3.
# WHY DO WE NEED TO HOST STATIC WEBSITES INSTED OF DYNAMIC WEBSITE?
ANS-: static website provide us Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness,Performance,Scalability,SecurityHosting on Object StorageContent Delivery:
# WHAT IS VERSIONING AND WHY DO WE NEED ?
ANS-:, keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket. Each time you upload a new version of an object, Amazon S3 automatically archives the previous version. Versioning provides several benefits for data management, recovery, and protection:
# WHAT ARE THE OBJECT AND TYPE OF OBJECT THAT WE ARE UPLOADING INTO S3 BUCKET?
ANS-: An object in Amazon S3 is the basic unit of storage. It represents the data that you upload to S3.
TYPE OF OBJECT -: Text files (e.g., .txt, .csv)
Images (e.g., .jpg, .png)
Videos (e.g., .mp4)
Binary data (e.g., compressed files, executables)
# WHY IS MFA DELETE IMPORTANT IN S3 BUCKET OBJECT LEVEL ?
ANS-: is an additional security feature in Amazon S3 that helps protect your data by requiring multi-factor authentication before allowing the deletion of objects in a bucket.
1 Accidental Deletion Prevention 2 Enhanced Security 3 Data Protection and Compliance 4 Irreversibility of Deletion
# WHAT IS S3 MULTIPART UPLOAD ?
ANS-:  is a feature in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that allows you to upload large objects in parts. Instead of uploading the entire object in a single request, you can break it into smaller parts and upload them in parallel. 
*# WHAT IS THE STORAGE CLASS IN S3 ?
ANS-: 1 Standard 2 Intelligent-Tiering 3 One Zone-Infrequent Access 4 Glacier 5 Glacier Deep Archive 6 Reduced Redundancy Storage
# WHAT IS ACL?
ANS-: Access Control Lists are used to control access to AWS resources. They are a set of rules that define what actions are allowed or denied on a resource for a specific entity or group of entities.
WHAY DO WE NEED ACL ?
ANS-:  providing a means to control and manage access to resources. Here are some key reasons why ACLs are essential
1 sequrity 2 data pritection 3 network serurity in vpc 4 custmization of access policies
# WHAT IS A LIFE CYCLE POLICY ? WHY DO WE NEED TO USE LIFE CYCLE RULE ?
ANS-:is a set of rules that define actions to be taken on objects stored in a bucket over time. These rules are used to automate the management of objects, typically to optimize storage costs, enhance data security, and ensure compliance.
# HOW CAN WE MAKE OUR BUKET POLICY ?
ANS-: To create a bucket policy in Amazon S3, you can define a JSON-based policy document that specifies the permissions for the bucket. 
# HOW CAN WE GIVE PUBLIC ACESS TO OUR BUKET ? 
ANS-: Giving public access to an Amazon S3 bucket involves configuring the bucket policy to allow certain permissions to the public. 
# AWS PRICING FACTOR OF  THE S3 SERVICE.
ANS-:important to understand these factors to estimate and manage your costs effectively.
1 storsge class 2 storage usages 3 data transfer 4 transfer acceleration 
# HOW CAN WE MAKE OUR OBJECT PUBLIC ?
ANS-:  you can adjust the permissions on that specific object to allow public access
# HOW CAN WE CONFIGURE THE STTIC WEBSIE LOG IN S3 ?
ANS-:
# WHATE IS CORS ?
ANS-: IN AWS, CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources hosted on another DOMIAN 
#  WHAT IS S3 INVENTORY?
ANS-: S3 Inventory is a feature provided by Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that allows you to generate reports about your objects and their metadata within an S3 bucket
# WHAT DOES MEAN BY REQUESTER PAY ?
ANS-: "Requester Pays" refers to a feature that allows the owner of an S3 bucket to configure the bucket so that the requester (the one making the S3 API request) pays for the data transfer and request costs associated with accessing objects in the bucket.
# WHAT IST SECONDRY WORD TO TRANFER ACCESRELATION ? WHY DO WE NEED TO USE THIS TRANSFER ACCESLERATION ?
ANS-:Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature of Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that uses the CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) to accelerate uploading and downloading of objects to and from your S3 bucket.
