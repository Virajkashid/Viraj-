DIFFIRENC BETWEEN BLOCK STORAGE AND OBJECT STORSGE?
ANS-: 1 BLOCK STORAGE- 1) Block storage provides raw storage volumes that can be attached to compute instances such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances
2) It operates at the block level, meaning it manages data in fixed-sized blocks and doesn't have any knowledge of the file structure.
3) Block storage is commonly used for databases, file systems, and applications that require low-level access to storage.
4)  Provides low-level access to raw storage and is often used as a block device attached to a specific compute instance.
2 OBJECT STORAGE-: 1)Objects are stored with metadata and a unique identifier, and they are organized in a flat address space. 
2)Object storage is ideal for scenarios where you need scalable and durable storage for large amounts of data, such as backup and restore, media storage, and content distribution.
3)Stores data as objects with associated metadata and is suitable for unstructured data
4)Provides seamless scalability, often with automatic load balancing and distribution across multiple servers.
DIFFERNCE BETWEEN STATIC WEBSITE AND DYNAMIC WEBSITE?
ANS-: STAIIC WEBSITE - 1) A static website consists of fixed, unchanging files that are directly served to the useR
2)The content remains the same for all users and is created during the development phase.
3) Static websites are often built using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.
4) Static websites tend to load faster because the content is already created and doesn't require server-side processing before being sent to the user's browser.
DYNAMIC WEBSITE-1)Dynamic websites generate content on the server side in real-time based on user requests and interactions.
2) Dynamic websites use server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) and may involve a database to retrieve and deliver content
3) Dynamic websites can be slower to load because content is generated on the server in response to user requests.
4)E-commerce sites, social media platforms, content management systems (CMS), web applications with interactive features.
WHAT ARE THE NAMING RULE ?
ANS-:1 NOT USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS 2 NOT USE DOMAIN NAME 3 NOT USE IP ADDRESS 4 NOT USE CAPITAL LATERS 
WHAT IS THE MAJOR RESOURCE OF S3 BUKET ?
ANS-:  An S3 bucket is a container for storing objects, and it serves as the fundamental resource in the S3 storage system. Buckets are used to organize and control access to your data stored in S3.
WHY DO WE NEED TO HOST STATIC WEBSITES INSTED OF DYNAMIC WEBSITE?
ANS-: static website provide us Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness,Performance,Scalability,SecurityHosting on Object StorageContent Delivery:
WHAT IS VERSIONING AND WHY DO WE NEED ?
ANS-:, keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket. Each time you upload a new version of an object, Amazon S3 automatically archives the previous version. Versioning provides several benefits for data management, recovery, and protection:
