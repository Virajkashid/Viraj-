2) NETWORK ACCESS CONTROAL LISTS-
1 Operate at the subnet level. They are associated with subnets and provide stateless filtering of traffic
2  Use rules that are evaluated in a rule-number order. Rules are stateless, so you must define separate inbound and outbound rules
3 Support both allow and deny rules. You can define both ALLOW and DENY rules for inbound and outbound traffic based on source/destination IP, port, and protocol.
4 Are stateless. You must create separate inbound and outbound rules for each allowed connection, as there is no automatic response rule like in SGs.
