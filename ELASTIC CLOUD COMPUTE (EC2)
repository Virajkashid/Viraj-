# WHAT IS EC2 WHY DO WE NEED EC2 SERVICE IN CLOUD COMPUTING ?
ANS-: it provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Essentially, EC2 allows users to rent virtual machines (known as instances) on which they can run their applications.
WHY WE USE 1 Scalability 2 Flexibility 3 Cost-Effectiveness 4 Security 5 Global Reach
# FEATURES OF AMAZON EC2 ?
ANS-: 1 Virtual Servers  2 Scalability 3 Elastic Load Balancing 4 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) 5 Auto Scaling 6 Security Groups and Network ACLs
# WHAT IS HYPERVIOSR AND ITS TYPE ?
ANS-: A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a software or hardware component that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host machine
TYPE - 1 Bare Metal Hypervisor 2 Hosted Hypervisor
# WHRE WE USR HYPERVISOR ?
ANS-: hypervisors are used as a fundamental component of the underlying infrastructure to enable the virtualization of computing resources.
# STEPS TO CREST EC2 INSTANC ?
ANS-: 1 LOG IN CONSOL 2 CLICK ON CREAE INSTANC SYMBOL 3 Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) 4 Choose an Instance Type 5 CONFIGURE INSTANC 6 ADD STORAG 7 CONGIGURE SEQURITY GROUP 8 ADD  KEY 9 LOUNCH INSTANC 10 VIEW INSTANC 
# EC2 INSTANC STATE ?
ANS-: 1 PENDING 2 RUNNING 3 STOPPING 4 STOPPED 5 TEMINATING 6 TERMINATED 7 SHUTTING DOWN 
# HOW MANY TYPE OF EC2 INSTANC-STATE CODES ?
ANS-: 6 TYPES OF INSTANC STATE CODE HERE  IS 
1 0: pending 2 16: running 3 32: shutting-down 4 48: terminated 5 64: stopping 6 80: stopped
# WHAT IS MEANING OF SERVER HIBERNATING MODE ?
ANS-:  server operating systems, hibernation typically refers to a power-saving state where the contents of the system's memory (RAM) are saved to disk
# WHAT IS KMS ?
ANS-:AWS Key Management Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to create, control, and manage cryptographic keys used to encrypt your data. It integrates with other AWS services and provides a centralized way to manage cryptographic keys for your applications.
# AWS AMAZON EC2 INSTANC TYPE ?
ANS-: 1 General Purpose Instances 2 Compute Optimized Instances 3 Memory Optimized Instances  4 Storage Optimized Instances 5 Accelerated Computing Instances 6 Instances for AWS Graviton Processors
# HOW MANY TYPE OF STATUS CHECK HAPPEN IN AWS ?
ANS-: 2 TYPE OF CHEC STATUS HERE IS 1 System Status Checks 2 Instance Status Checks 
# WHEN WE SEE THE GLOBALE VIEW OPTION IN EC2 SERVICE ?
ANS-:
# WHEN WE LOGGED INTO THE CLOUD ACCOUNT BY DEFAULT WHY WE ALWAYS JUMP IN NORTH VERGINIA REGION WHY ITS MOST POPULER ?
ANS-:automatically directs users to the North Virginia (us-east-1) region by default when they log in to the AWS Management Console.
1 Historical Significance 2 Service Availability 3 Network Connectivity 4 Pricing
# WHAT ARE EBS VOLUME AND ITS TYPE ?
ANS-:Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block storage service provided by AWS that allows you to create and attach persistent block-level storage volumes to Amazon EC2 instances
TYPE OF EBS- 1 General Purpose SSD 2 Provisioned IOPS SSD  3 Throughput Optimized HDD 4 Cold HDD Cold HDD 5 Magnetic (standard)  
# PURPOSE OF USING EBS VOLUME ?
ANS-: 1 Data Persistence 2 Boot Volumes 3 Data Storage for Applications 4 Database Storage 5 Backup and Snapshots 6 High Performance Workloads 7 Scalability 
# HOW MANY TYPE OF PURCHASING OPTION DO WE HAVE IN EC2 INSTANC ?
ANS-: 1 On-Demand Instances 2 Reserved Instances (RIs) 3 Spot Instances 4 Dedicated Hosts 5 Savings Plans 6 Instances Purchased Through AWS Marketplace 
# DIFFERNCE BETWEEN AWS AMI IMAGES AND AWS TEMPLETE ?
ANS -: 1) AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE (AMI) -
1 An AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image, which includes an operating system, application server, and applications.
2  AMIs are primarily used for launching EC2 instances.
3  You can create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance or build a custom AMI by bundling your configurations and applications.
4 AMIs are useful for creating consistent environments, enabling scalability, and ensuring repeatability in your infrastructure.
2) AWS TEMPLETE-
1 An AWS template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file that describes the set of resources and properties needed to run an application or workload on AWS.
2 Templates are used with AWS CloudFormation, a service that helps you model and provision AWS infrastructure in a safe, predictable, and scalable manner. Templates define the infrastructure as code. 
3 ou write templates to define the AWS resources, their relationships, and the properties necessary for your application
4 Templates are used for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling you to version and manage your infrastructure in a systematic way.
# WHAT IS NIC AND ITS TYPE ?
ANS-: Network Interface Controller or Network Interface Card. It is a hardware component or a virtual entity that allows a device, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, to connect to a network
TYPE OF NIC- 1 Primary Network Interface 2 Additional Network Interfaces (SECONDRY)
